# Privacy Policy for VocabuDaily

**Last Updated:** February 8, 2026

VocabuDaily is a free, open-source word-of-the-day app. This policy explains what limited data is collected when you use the app and how it is used.

---

## Information We Collect

### Diagnostic Data
VocabuDaily may collect anonymous crash reports and basic usage diagnostics through the Expo platform (the framework the app is built on). This data helps identify and fix bugs. It does not include any personally identifiable information.

### Push Notification Tokens
If you opt in to daily word notifications, Apple generates a device token that is used solely to deliver notifications to your device. This token is managed by Apple's Push Notification service (APNs) and is not stored on any VocabuDaily server.

### API Usage
When the app fetches the word of the day, a request is sent to the Wordnik API. Wordnik may log these API requests in accordance with their own privacy policy. VocabuDaily does not receive or store any personal data from these requests.
